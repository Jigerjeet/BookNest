# BookNest
BookNest is a sleek, full-stack web application built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, designed to help users manage their personal book collection with ease and elegance. It features a clean, responsive UI and a robust backend that supports dynamic book entry, storage, and display.
Users can:
    Add new books with title, author, and rating
    View all stored books in a beautifully styled list
    Navigate between pages seamlessly using Flask routing

The app uses SQLite for lightweight data persistence and demonstrates key concepts in ORM modeling, form handling, and template rendering with Jinja2. It also includes input validation and a modular structure that makes it easy to extend with features like editing, deleting, or filtering books.
